# Graphql Practice project
### Gist
1. Graphql doesnot provide cookie sending capability hence requires express's middleware.
2. Once nested query is set up in model and resolver between models then client is responsible for fetching complex data.
3. Should make graphql folder structure at first.
4. Need separate front end library to handle graphql response, fetch can't handle graphql response.
5. There may arise issue in cachine at frontend.
